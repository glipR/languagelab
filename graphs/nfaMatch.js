    Some number facts:

      <li>Even numbers always end in a 0,2,4,6,8</li>
      <li>The digit sum of x has the same remainder when divided by 3 as x.</li>
    </ul>
    For the second point, an example: 957 when divided by 3, gives remainder 0. So does 9+5+7 = 21.

    Try making NFAs which match each of these numbers (divisible by 2 and divisible by 3) separately.
    `,
    `
    For even numbers, this is just checking for a particular suffix (or just final character) on the number.

    <br>
    For numbers divisible by 3, another way of looking at it is that we can keep track of the remainder when divided by 3, as we read the number.

    For example, take the number 123456. For each prefix of the number, we can calculate the remainder when divided by 3, purely using the next number in the string.

    <ul>
      <li>1 % 3 = 1</li>
      <li>12 % 3 = (1 + 2) % 3 = 0</li>
      <li>123 % 3 = (0 + 3) % 3 = 0</li>
      <li>1234 % 3 = (0 + 4) % 3 = 1</li>
      <li>12345 % 3 = (1 + 5) % 3 = 0</li>
      <li>123456 % 3 = (0 + 6) % 3 = 0</li>
    </ul>

    Your NFA can take a very similar strategy to this. What is the acceptance condition?
    `,
    `
    For numbers divisible by 3, create three states, to represent the current remainder when divided by 3.
    Each state should have a transition to itself, with label 0,3,6,9, since these, if added to the current number, would not change the remainder.
    For 1,4,7 and 2,5,8, these would change the remainder, so they should transition to one of the two other states. Which?
    `,
    `
    This NFA matches strings of numbers representing numbers divisible by 3:

    <img src="/img/match/nfadiv3.png" />

    1,4,7 should increase the remainder of the total number by 1, going to 0 when the previous remainder was 2.
    2,5,8 should increase the remainder of the total number by 2 (Which is the same as decreasing the remainder by 1), going to 2 when the previous remainder was 0.
